# Streams

In the process of Presentation, defining which content to be listed where is the hardest and most changing part.
Change of request may occur, needs may change or new areas have to be added to the design.

Streams break the dependency between Data Source and Development which not only improves the development process but also makes 
it possible for Content Managers to add new streams to existing pages.

Stream Types:

* Automatic
Automatic streams list data from Elastic Search which means that, after defining conditions, you don't need to add new 
data to the stream to list it. Response will be generated automatically.

Example:
- Most visited articles
- Latest news
- Most liked videos
- All articles in a category

* Manual 
Manual streams list the data you choose manually. Admin User decides which data to be listed manually.

Example:
- Articles picked by Editors
- Predefined list of Products

* Custom
Custom Data Sources make it possible to add new data sources to the system programatically.

Example:
- Watched Videos for current user
- Favorited Series of the user
- Suggested Products generated by AI

* Stunt
Sometimes, you may want to link contents picking by hand or sourcing from another system. Stunt streams makes it possible 
to return Items that are related to current Item.

Example:
- Related articles where all relations are defined manually in article detail pages.
