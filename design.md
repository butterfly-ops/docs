# Introduction

Designs are the gateway for Butterfly Presentation Layer. You can manage your outputs using Designs. Designs are composed of Widgets.
If you are building a Webpage, Designs outputs HTML. If you are building a webservice, Designs outputs JSON data.

## Terminologies

### Designs

Let's move on with an example case:

- You want to build an Ecommerce Website.
- You have the following Pages:
    - Homepage
    - Product Detail Page
    - Category Listing Page
    - Cart Page

You can think each of these pages as Designs which means that, Designs are generic Look & Feels of your website. You don't need
to create different Designs for each Category or Product. You may have a single Product Detail Design for all Products.

>[!TIP]
> You can also define Design for a Specific Item or Group of Items. 

### Widgets

Widgets are the minor segments of Designs. For the Ecommerce Website Example, Let's think about Homepage,

- You have a Homepage Design,
- There are Header and Footer in the page,
- There is a Slider under Header.
- Best Selling Products
- Latest Products (with the Same Look & Feel with Best Selling Products)

In this case study, you will have the following Widgets: Header, Footer, Slider, ProductList

As you see, Best Selling Products and Latest Products are the same Widget with different Parameters.
