### Data Types

Butterfly has your back(end). You can create your Admin Panel without writing a single code for creating Pages of Listing, Filtering, Editing,
Adding new Entities.

Using Butterfly Data Types, you can define your data into the system like User Friendly Name for the Data Type, table name, Link Format for Frontend. Then,
your Admin Panel will be ready like a magic.

Unlike other solutions, Butterfly don't leave you with a messed up Database, you will have your different tables for each of your
Data Types, you will have clean column names which you named in definitions entered from Data Management Screens.

Checkout [Data Types](https://thebutterfly.io/docs/#/data-types) page for more details.

### Permissions

Roles, Permissions, Audit Logs are the most time consuming parts of an Admin Panel. You need to write long lines of codes to maintain
each page in the Admin Panel.

With Butterfly, you don't need to write any single line of code for these needs. Butterfly automatically adds Data Types created from Admin Panel to
Permissions Screen which means that you can define Roles and assign Add / Edit / Delete or View permissions for Data Types even for individual columns.

Check out [Permissions](https://thebutterfly.io/docs/#/data-types?id=permissions) page for more details.

### Design Manager

Design in terms of Butterfly is the presentation layer of the system. If you have a website, you can think Desktop or Mobile browsers,
if you have a backend application, you can think a webservice that outputs your data defined in Data Pools.

Widgets which is a smaller, resuable, dynamic are building blocks of Designs. You can create a Widget and re-used it in your application.

Checkout [Designs](https://thebutterfly.io/docs/#/design) page for more details.
