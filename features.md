### Objects

Butterfly has your back(end). You can create your Admin Panel without writing a single code for creating Pages of Listing, Filtering, Editing,
Adding new Entities.

Using Butterfly Objects, you can define your data into the system like User Friendly Name for the Object, table name, Link Format for Frontend. Than, 
your Admin Panel will be ready like a magic.

Unlike other solutions, Butterfly don't leave you with a messed up Database, you will have your different tables foreach of your 
Objects, you will have clean column names which you named in defitions entered from Object Management Screens.

Checkout Objects page for more details.

### Permissions

Roles, Permissions, Audit Logs are the most time consuming parts of an Admin Panel. You need to write long lines of codes to maintain
each page in the Admin Panel.

With Butterfly, you don't need to write any single line of code for these needs. Butterfly automatically adds Objects created from Admin Panel to 
Permissions Screen which means that you can define Roles and assign Add / Edit / Delete or View permissions for Objects even for individual columns.  

Check out Permissions page for more details.
