# File Storage

When dealing with scalable Cloud Systems, everyone needs different File Storages. butterfly provides an abstraction layer for you 
to upload your static images / files.

## Storage Drivers

You can use multiple storages at the same time. Storages are managed under `System Settings > CMS - File Storages` page. You
can add / edit / remove storages.

File Storage Drivers are:

- Local Folder
- Amazon S3
- Azure Blob Storage
- SFTP
- FTP
