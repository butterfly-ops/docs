Just give it a chance and watch it while spreading inside your organization.</p>\n<p>Butterflies are said to live short. They don't have time to waste. Do we have? Butterfly makes you reach your goals without wasting your time. </p>\n<p>We hate repeating ourselves. We don’t have so much time to do the same thing again and again. That’s why we’ve built Butterfly.</p>\n<p>Butterfly is not something that can be considered as a Content Management System, Video Management System, Customer Relationship Management or even an ERP. It's a Platform that you can use it for any purpose.</p>\n<p>Quality and functionality should be the standard. In order to build qualified software in a cost and time efficient manner, you need your tool to support it</p>\n<p>Butterfly is lightweight, besides it can be used to build a high-level enterprise product; it can be embedded into your applications using Magento, Wordpress or anything else.</p>\n</blockquote>"
